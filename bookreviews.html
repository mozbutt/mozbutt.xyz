  <h1>📖 Book Reviews</h1>
  <p>Critical reflections on legal theory, systems thinking, computation, and adjacent texts.</p>

  <h2>📘 The Concept of Law – H.L.A. Hart</h2>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hart reconstructs legal positivism using the distinction between primary and secondary rules, and offers a procedural account of legal authority.</p>
  <p><strong>Review:</strong> A foundational text, but its treatment of discretion lacks formal constraint. Strong on conceptual clarity, weak on auditability under complex systems.</p>

  <h2>📗 The Inner Morality of Law – Lon Fuller</h2>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Fuller argues that law contains an internal morality: consistency, publicity, prospectivity, and congruence between rules and enforcement.</p>
  <p><strong>Review:</strong> Closer to a procedural ethic than a moral code. Useful in evaluating system legitimacy, but assumes too much about interpretive convergence.</p>
