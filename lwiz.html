    <h2>What is L-Wiz?</h2>

    <p>
        Legal information is fragmented across sources, inconsistently formatted, poorly searchable, and often mediated by institutions with paywalls or access constraints. The structure of legal knowledge is neither transparent nor operable, hidden behind unintuitive UI's and poorly written search functions.
</p>

    <p>
       If law is to be engaged seriously by those who require access, it must be restructured for usability. Not just readable law: but searchable, annotatable, and exportable.
    </p>

    <p>
        That is the premise behind <strong>L-Wiz Terminal</strong>: a tiling manager style legal web application that functions as a swiss army knife for legal research and organisation. L-Wiz allows users to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Search legislation and case law through a unified tiling interface</li>
        <li>Upload and locally store their own documents or case notes</li>
        <li>Create and export annotations for cross-reference or citation</li>
        <li>Operate entirely offline if needed, with structured file based organisation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The core insight is simple: legal work is inherently modular, abstract, and procedurally complex. Yet the tools available to most students, practitioners, or self-represented litigants resemble broken portals rather than structured environments. L-Wiz aims to replace that friction with a functional workspace fast, exportable, and extensible.
    </p>

    <h2> Where can i find it? </h2>
    <p>
        L-Wiz is currently in its early stages of development. Our focus is on establishing a minimal, fast, and consistent web environment for legal work. The goal is not to replicate commercial legal software, but to offer a fundamentally different paradigm: one where legal materials are local, searchable, annotatable, and unconstrained by proprietary restraints.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are building from first principles starting with core functionality like text indexing, query tables, and local case storage. As the tool develops, the aim is to provide a  interface for legal researches, students and practitioners: a workspace that aligns with the way law is actually practiced: structured, coherent, results based.
